# pagarme-angular-styleguide
The awesome angular.js styleguide that we follow at Pagar.me

The goal of this styleguide is to provide guidance when developing angularjs applications, such as best practices and conventions.

Inspired at these two awesome styleguides written by [John Papa](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide) and [Todd Motto](https://github.com/toddmotto/angularjs-styleguide).
